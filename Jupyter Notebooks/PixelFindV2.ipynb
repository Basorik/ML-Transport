    "This while loop is the core of the function and keeps iterating until the queue of pixels is complete. The queue is seeded with the initial pixel originally, and finds the neighbouring pixels of this starting point. The 6 color values of these neighbours are compared to the average color values of all the pixels calculated so far (initially using the starting area as described above). The difference in value for all 6 color variables is then multiplied with the variable weights set above, and summed together. If this total sum is less than the threshold the neighbouring pixel is accepted and added to the 'inQueue' set as long as it is not already within one of the three sets described in the setup. It is then added to the end of the 'qP' queue.If it is not within any of the sets but fails the threshold test it is instead placed into the 'failed' set and not added to the queue. This set process ensures that failed pixels are never added to the queue and that no pixel gets placed into the queue twice.  \n",
